<h2 id="events">Events</h2>

<p>Presently the only event fired is <code>event.document.did_save</code>.</p>

<p>Catching an event is done by adding an <code>eventSpecifier</code> key to a regular command and setting the value to the event which should be caught.</p>

<p>An example of this is the “Make Script Executable” in the included Avian bundle. This is scoped to <code>source.ruby</code> so if you create a new ruby file and save it, it should automatically get the executable bit set.</p>

<h2 id="filters">Filters</h2>

<p>Filters are like events but their output is used. Examples of filters are in the included Avian bundle, there are filters to decompile AppleScript, pretty print tmCommand files, and encrypt/decrypt the content.</p>
